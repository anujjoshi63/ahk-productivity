# useful-ahk-shortcuts
My AutoHotKey script that I start as a startup script that allows me to have very customized keyboard shortcuts for daily/frequent activities.

## setting up the hack
  (for windows)
- Download & Install AutoHotKey [from here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
- Modify the paths and actions as per your needs in `setup.ahk` (Refer [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm))
- Press `WIN` + `R` and type-in `shell:startup` and click `OK`
- Copy-paste the setup.ahk file in the opened directory.
- Restart your system.
